// A Traverser provides the ability to run a job chain while respecting the
// dependencies between the jobs.
type Traverser interface {
	// Run traverses a job chain and runs all of the jobs in it. It starts by
	// running the first job in the chain, and then, if the job completed,
	// successfully, running its adjacent jobs. This process continues until there
	// are no more jobs to run, or until the Stop method is called on the traverser.

	// signal to all of the jobs that a traverser is running.

	// It returns an error if it fails to stop all running jobs.
